    # and closed after the operation, preventing resource leaks
    # The retry_on_failure decorator ensures that transient errors are handled gracefully
    # and the function is retried if necessary
    # The function is designed to be robust against temporary failures, making it suitable for production use
    # The function returns a list of users fetched from the database
    # The connection is passed as an argument, allowing the decorator to manage it
    # The function can be called without worrying about connection management or retry logic
    # The function is decorated with both decorators to ensure proper connection handling and retry logic
    # The decorators are applied in the order they are defined, with the innermost decorator
    # being executed first
    # The outer decorator (with_db_connection) manages the database connection,
    # while the inner decorator (retry_on_failure) handles the retry logic
    # The function is designed to be reusable and can be called multiple times
    # without needing to redefine the connection or retry logic
    # The function can be extended or modified to include additional logic as needed
    # The function is a good example of how to combine decorators for enhanced functionality
    # The function is a simple example of how to use decorators to enhance functionality
